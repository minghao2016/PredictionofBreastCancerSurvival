"# PredictionofBreastCancerSurvival" 
Cancer is a notoriously heterogeneous disease which makes tracking its progression and severity incredibly difficult. The most common cancer staging system is the TNM (tumor, nodes, metastasis) system which is based primarily on clinical information like tumor size, extent of spread, etc. Combining phenotypic and molecular data from cancer patients can lead to more detailed descriptions of disease progression and severity. I experimented with three molecular datasets (DNA methylation, RNASeq and miRNASeq data) along with Clinical dataset to predict the overall survival of breast cancer patients. I experimented with linear models (SVM, KNN, PCA with SVM) on individual datasets along with Neural nets followed by applying models on combined datasets .I have taken 4 datasets from the Linked Omics database which has organized and compiled data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project.
